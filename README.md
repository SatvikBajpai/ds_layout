## Rack Specifications

| Rack Type | Width | Height | Capacity | Color Code |
|-----------|-------|--------|----------|------------|
| **Standard** | 1.2m | 2.4m | 200 units | #4CAF50 (Green) |
| **High-Density** | 0.8m | 3.0m | 300 units | #2196F3 (Blue) |
| **Freezer** | 1.5m | 2.0m | 150 units | #00BCD4 (Cyan) |
| **Bulk Storage** | 2.0m | 1.5m | 100 units | #FF9800 (Orange) |

## Optimization Algorithm

The scoring system uses a weighted approach:

- **Layout Efficiency (30%)**: Rack area utilization ratio
- **Accessibility Score (25%)**: Distance to entrance/loading dock
- **Workflow Score (25%)**: Grid regularity and arrangement patterns
- **Density Score (20%)**: Space utilization within rack clusters

## Safety & Industry Standards

### Aisle Requirements
- **Minimum Aisle Width**: 1.8 meters
- **Main Aisle Width**: 2.5 meters  
- **Safety Clearance**: 0.5 meters
- **Optimal Aisle Ratio**: 30-40% of total floor space

### Compliance Standards
- OSHA warehouse safety requirements
- International dark store best practices
- Based on Amazon, Instacart, and Ocado operations
- Emergency egress and fire safety compliance

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Stack
- **HTML5**: Semantic structure with accessibility features
- **CSS3**: Modern grid layout with animations and responsive design
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Real-time optimization engine
- **SVG**: Scalable vector graphics for layout visualization

### Core JavaScript Classes
- `RackOptimizer`: Main optimization engine
- Constraint validation system
- Grid-based placement algorithm
- Real-time scoring calculations

### Optimization Features
- Grid-based rack placement (2m √ó 2m grid)
- Rectangle overlap detection
- Aisle width validation
- Distance-based scoring
- Variance calculation for workflow assessment
